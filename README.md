# KHerum? (Nepali for What to see?)

KHerum? is a movie recommender system that makes content based recommendations.
I have used bag of words as the method of vectorization here.
Dataset available at: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata?select=tmdb_5000_movies.csv

using TMDB's dataset for about 5000 movies, this application is built with streamlit and takes a movie, returning 5 recommendations.

Make sure you have latest version of python3 installed.
Furthermore, install streamlit, ast, nltk, pickle, and requests. 
These are libraries used in this project. 

Useage:

1. download the files
2. the ipynb file you run will create all required ".pkl" files
3. you can run the app.py file, which starts your application at available port 8501, make sure its free or reconfigure your port manually.
